<p>headlines” (Sheier, 2001). Data mining is also used for national security and military
    applications – examples of which are provided in the next two paragraphs.</p>
<p>After the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the new
antiterrorist law (The USA Patriot Act of 2001) allows wiretapping of the Net, among other
things. However through this increased ability for surveillance comes the realization that
we do not have enough personnel working for the FBI to analyze all this data. Therefore,
data mining will play a part in providing national security. However, using data mining
to search for suspicious keywords could be problematic.</p>
<p>“As ‘60 Minutes’ reported, the Canadian Security Agency identified a mother
as a potential terrorist after she told a friend on the phone that her son had
‘bombed’ in his school play. Filtered or unfiltered information taken out of
context is no substitute for the genuine knowledge about a person that can
emerge only slowly over time.” (Rosen, 2001, p. 19)</p>
<p>Advances in networking, medical remote sensing, and data mining will, in the future,
be combined to detect the presence and origin of chemical weapons on the battlefield
(Ceruti, 2000). This will be accomplished by:</p>
<p>“Mining geographic patterns from networks of devices worn by troops in the
field designed to record and transmit a soldier’s or a marine’s vital health data
and environmental data. These geographic patterns will help to identify the
origin of the attack. It will also affect the early response and treatment of
wartime casualties with a result of more lives saved on the battlefield.” (Ceruti,
2000, p. 1875)</p>
<p>Another military application of data mining revolves around intrusion detection
systems for military networks. Unlike their commercial counterparts, military networks</p>
<p>“often face unique constraints – operation over wireless media, unique
message traffic, different perceived threats, limited bandwidth, mobile and
dynamic environment, robustness in the face of direct attacks on infrastructure – that lead to ‘normal’ operation that is different from civilian networks.</p>
<p>This results in an unacceptably high false-alarm rate from Intrusion Detection
systems.” (Clifton & Gengo, 2000, p. 440)</p>
<p> Data mining can be used to identify patterns of false alarms created during
battlefield conditions that are substantially different from commercial traffic.</p>
<p>What are the social implications of such systems? Next, we explore the benefits and
drawbacks of data mining in terms of individuals, society, and businesses.</p>
<h2> Data Mining and Consumers</h2>
<p>Why pursue data mining? Simply satisfying customers is not enough. Relationships need to be built based on loyalty fostered by employee enthusiasm and customized
product and service offerings that delight customers. Customers expect that businessesanticipate their needs. A number of studies have shown that it costs five to ten times
as much money to attract a new customer as it does to sell to an existing customer. Data
mining allows management to create and analyze customer profiles to appropriately
customize marketing efforts. Companies are beginning to realize that they do not need
to market to large masses of customers in order to maximize profits. Hence, data mining
can be beneficial to both consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>However, the benefits to a
company, which may reduce costs for the consumer, may also be seen as an invasion of
consumer privacy. Obviously, this has large-scale social implications. We will take a look
at some examples of businesses mining data</p>
<h2>Insurance Rates</h2>
<p>One insurer used data mining to help develop competitive rates
for sports car owners. These owners are often charged higher rates because it is assumed
these drivers are riskier than other drivers. One insurer found that a majority of sportscar
owners are between 30 and 50 years old, married and own two cars. “Data mining
uncovered the fact that those customers were not high-risk drivers, so the insurer
reduced its premiums and provided a competitive edge” (Maciag, 2001, p. 35).</p>
<h2>Manufacturing and Inventory:</h2>
<p>How can suppliers increase their ability to deliver
the right products to the right place at the right time? The supply chain can account for
as much as 75% of a product’s cost. One company that is attempting to decrease this
cost by manufacturing its product in direct proportion to actual consumer demand rather
than forecasts is Proctor & Gamble (P&G). P&G has tested technology that will inform
it the moment a customer lifts one of its products off the store shelf, whether it is Downy
fabric softener, Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste, or Charmin toilet paper (Dalton,
2001). A</p>
<p> A trial run was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland with an unidentified retailer.</p>
<p>This new technology could provide a wealth of data that consumer goods manufacturers could mine for predictive patterns and, rather than reacting to sales, they could
foresee peaks and valleys in demand. It costs approximately $10 each for the circuit
boards for store shelves and five cents apiece for the chips for individual packages
(Dalton, 2001). The hope is to reduce this latter price to one cent each. When a consumer
picks up a product, it signals the shelf. It also signals if it is put back on the shelf. The
shelf transmits the data to a computer which then periodically, but frequently, transmits
it to P&G. P&G can then adjust its manufacturing plans accordingly. Currently, a few
large suppliers like P&G wait only a few (four or five) days to obtain data collected at
checkout. Most companies wait from 20 to 30 days to obtain checkout data. Therefore,
even if this technology proves too expensive for widespread deployment, it can be used
at a few select locations to test consumer response to new products and predict demand
for existing products. Hence, what benefits could P&G accrue from such technology?
It could obtain sales data in practically real time, which would in turn decrease pipeline
inventories. This would also increase working capital, and give P&G a greater ability to
deliver the right products to the right place at the right time – ultimately benefiting
consumers in the form of lower costs and less stockouts</p>
<h2>Record Matching:</h2>
<p>Most data is never used. Data warehouses are often data tombs.
However, data-mining techniques make this data more useful and meaningful. Another
area in which data mining might be used in a positive social manner is where “fuzzy set
logic” is used. When analyzing data, it is important to weed out “matches” or duplicate
entries. Data mining helps determine if you have a match, whether it matches well,
matches fairly well, matches somewhat, matches poorly, or there is a complete mismatch
(Bell & Sethi, 2001). For example, if you were analyzing records, and the social securitynumber matches but nothing else matches, then the records associated with one of the
two individuals might possibly indicate fraud. The logic associated with matching
records from a number of sources can take into account events that naturally occur in
one’s life. For example, the rule</p>
<p>If the first name matches well and the last name is a mismatch, and the subject
is a female, and date of birth matches, and social security number matches, and
the maiden name matches well, and the place of birth matches well ,and marital
status of the old record is single or divorced, and marital status of the new
record is married, then the record probably matches [Marriage]. (Bell & Sethi,
2001, p. 88)</p>
<h2>Targeting Audiences:</h2>
<p>Instead of bombarding consumers indiscriminately, smart,
technologically savvy corporations use advanced data warehousing and data-mining
techniques to target their marketing efforts. Managing specialized customer knowledge
allows businesses to respond to customer needs even before these needs are expressed.
David Diamond is the President of Catalina Marketing, a Florida firm that operates
customer loyalty programs for 14,000 supermarkets in the United States. Through data
mining, he stated that one chain had searched through customer purchases data finding
low-fat-food buyers who never bought potato chips. Using this data, the company
offered these customers a coupon for a new brand of low-calorie chips. Diamond stated
that 40% responded, which is much higher than the typical 1 or 2% you get from coupons
in the mail (“Selling is getting personal,” 2000).</p>
<h2>Web Mining:</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of data mining, based on clickstream analysis,
is that you can remove inventory from your product line that is not enhancing profitability. Another benefit is the ability to enhance product exposure through better marketing.
With the widespread use of the Internet, we cannot talk about data mining without
looking at Web mining. Specifically, we will look at “clickstream analysis.” Companies
with a Web presence that concentrate on content— rather than on the medium for
distributing that content— will be those that thrive and survive on the Internet. But how
does a company know what content is important? One answer is by analyzing clickstream
data. Clickstream data is much more than just tracking page hits. As a consumer traverses
a website, a trail of activity reveals his or her browsing behavior and potential interest
in a corporation’s products and services. Clickstream data captures data such as which
links are clicked by surfers, how long a surfer spends on each Web page, and what search
terms are used. Furthermore, if visitors fill out a profile or survey, even more information
can be gleaned by matching these with surfing behavior. Lastly, if the site belongs to
a third-party banner ad exchange, then the company might be able to track surfing
behavior beyond its own site. This trail of activity is commonly referred to as clickstream
data.</p>
<p>However, the sheer volume of data generated by consumers traversing a
corporation’s website requires that the data be condensed and summarized prior to its
storage in the corporate data warehouse (Inmon, 2001). As a consumer journeys through
a corporation’s website, many of the pages displayed have dynamic content. Capturing
this dynamic content in such a way that the user’s experience can later be analyzed is
a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. What often happens is that companies have
the capability to gather the data, but fail to act upon it because of the cost associatedwith analyzing it. As analysis tools simplify, more and more corporations will be mining
their clickstream data for patterns that might indicate answers to a number of questions.
Some issues that clickstream data can shed light on are (Inmon, 2001, p. 22):</p>
   <ol>
     <li>What items did the customer look at?</li>
    <li>What items did the customer not look at?</li>
    <li>What items did the customer purchase?</li>
    <li> What items did the customer examine and not purchase?</li>
    <li>What items did the customer buy in conjunction with other items?</li>
    <li>What items did the customer look at in conjunction with other items, but did not purchase?</li>
    <li>What advertisements or promotions are effective?</li>
    <li>What advertisements or promotions are ineffective?</li>
    <li>What advertisements or promotions generate a lot of attention but few sales?</li>
    <li>What advertisements or promotions are the most effective at generating sales?</li>
    <li> Are certain products too hard to find?</li>
    <li> Are certain products too expensive?</li>
    <li>Is there a substitute product that the customer finds first?</li>
    <li>Are there too many products for the customer to wade through?</li>
    <li>Are certain products not being promoted?</li>
    <li>Do the products have adequate descriptions?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Clickstream data allows an unprecedented analysis of consumer behavior. Obviously, when a consumer enters a store at a traditional physical location such as a mall,
it would be a very time-consuming process to analyze every product a consumer picked
up, every department he or she entered, and every interaction he or she had with a sales
clerk. Theoretically, you could do that, but, in essence, you would be conducting
surveillance on individuals. If the public found out such activity was being conducted,
clearly there would be a public outcry. On the other hand, on the Web, such analysis
is much easier. As time goes by, more and more companies are going to be turning to
their clickstream data and creating profiles based on customers’ online shopping data.
Of course, with this increased scrutiny should come increased protections, whether
through self-regulation or laws. This leads us to the issue of whether data mining benefits
or harms society.</p>
<h3>Customer Satisfaction:</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, companies have learned that they
need to interact with customers in new ways. Customers are not brand loyal like they once
were. Hence, companies need to better understand their customers and quickly respond
to their wants and needs. The time frame for a company to respond is also shrinking with
our “need it now” society. Businesses can no longer wait until the signs of customer
dissatisfaction are obvious before corrective action is taken. Businesses must now
anticipate customer desires. Given all of this, data mining is an obvious choice that
businesses must use to gain a strategic advantage, to maintain their customer base, and
to attract new customers.</p>
<p>It is often useful to examine a topic from several different perspectives. With respect
to data mining, three obvious perspectives are (1) businesses, (2) individuals, and (3)
society. Table 1 provides a list of benefits of data mining from each of these perspectives.
The list is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather illustrates how each of these groups.</p>
